## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project utilizes default packages within the Anaconda distribution of Python for the majority of the analysis. 

However, you will need to install plotly if you haven't already done so before. See [Getting Started with Plotly for Python](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/).

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.8 and above.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. What are the distribution of listing prices by neighborhoods?
2. How varied are the neighborhoods in terms of property type?
3. How well can we predict listing price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to address the questions above.

Please note that the notebook utilizes Plotly for a majority of the visualizations. Dependencies for doing so on your own local machine are mentioned above in the Installations section. 


The data is in the listings.csv file, which was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@gagankaurgill/airbnb-properties-analysis-for-seattle-67b89e68a274).
